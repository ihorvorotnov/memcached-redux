# Memcached Redux

A fork of [Memcached Redux](https://wordpress.org/plugins/memcached-redux/) plugin, with some (opinionated) changes:

- modernized codebase;
- proper access modifiers for class methods and properties (and no deprecated `var` anymore);
- stricter comparisons;
- fixed code style and formatting;
- inline documentation that is entirely missing in the original plugin (in progress);
- and more;
- and even more to come.

**Work in progress!**

Trying to keep it operational while in progress, but I can't guarantee it won't break at some point. Use at your own risk.

Once it's finished, well-tested and considered stable, this notice will be removed.
